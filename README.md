# JSjQ-War-Game
<p>My final project in the Javascript/jQuery class, a simplified version of the game War.</p>
<p><i>Description:</i> Insert your name and play against the machine in a simplified version of the game War (with no war involved). A deck is shuffled and then divided between you and the computer. Each round you and the machine will show a card, the one who have the most powerful card show will get both card value added in points. The one that cumulates more point until the end of both decks is the winner.</p>
<p><i>Tecnhologies used:</i> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery. </p>
